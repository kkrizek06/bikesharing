**Summary:**

The majority of bike riders are Male and the majority of trips are less than an hour with the peak trip duration being 5 minutes. Because of Male riders dominating much of the business, I would explore the ratio of males to females in NYC and compare this to the ratio in Des Moines. It also might be worth discussing a business plan to increase female rider participation. I also want to explore financial data. The data provided can help establish use of sharing service, but I would still like to know costs. How much is spent in bicycle maintenance; can this cost be lowered. How much can we charge subscribers for bike ride service in Des Moines. I would like to have the answers to these questions prior to moving forward on creating the ride sharing business in Des Moines.
